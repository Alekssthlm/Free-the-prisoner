# Free-the-prisoner-Desktop-only-

Second project at Hyper Island Stockholm. 

Create a simple game that let's you incorporate topics learned during the 3rd week of JS. 

DOM manipulation, javascript connected to HTML and CSS.

Game: Free the prisoner (2-player game!)

Similar to hangman, player 1 inputs word to be guessed. Player 2 guesses the word in order to win the game, with max 6 attempts. If you lose, you get busted!
